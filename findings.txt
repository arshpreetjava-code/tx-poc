- Generally we use HTTPs for secure communication.
- HTTPs ensures all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- In production we use real certificate issued by a trusted CA (like Letâ€™s Encrypt).
- We run or application behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx) which handles SSL termination.

Cons of using Encrypting by Base64:
- Base64 is not an encryption method; it is an encoding scheme. It does not provide any security.
- Anyone who intercepts Base64 encoded data can easily decode it back to its original form.
- Base64 does not protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, or data tampering.

So what we can use instead of Base64 for secure communication is:
- Use HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) for secure communication over the network.
- Use strong encryption algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for encrypting sensitive data.
